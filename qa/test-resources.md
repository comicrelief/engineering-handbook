# Test Resources

While performing tests, both manual and automated, we need resources to emulate realistic scenarios. This page aims to be a repository of references of those resources.

## Test Credit Cards

Test credit cards are to be used in user journeys that require payments / donation. Donations and Prize Platform are examples of such workflows. We can use the test credit cards to validate the workflow, assuring the user journey completes successfuly, and to test how the backend services process the payment event.
