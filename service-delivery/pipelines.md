# Pipelines & Automated Testing
***

We utilise CI/CD systems to deploy all code and infrastructure. This as vitaly important as means that all knowledge
is stored in VCS around how applications and services operate.

Once code review has been through the [pull request](pull-requests.md) process and is merged into the master branch, it
will then flow through its pipeline until it hits production.

All of our pipelines are within Concourse CI. All pipelines are managed within individual bootstraps for each project.
