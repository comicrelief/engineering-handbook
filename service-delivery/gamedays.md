# Gamedays
***

We regularly conduct gamedays across our applications to simulate high levels
of traffic and failure scenarios based on our [runbooks](runbooks.md).

These will be conducted with the engineering and product teams, and sometimes
with the wider business, to ensure readiness for production.

The aims of gamedays are as follows:

- To simulate production loads using [load tests](load-testing.md) to provide
  developers with confidence around production monitoring.

- To shed light on failure scenarios that we have not taken into account.

- To help the engineering team anticipate the stress of operating systems in a
  high-traffic production environment.

- To gain organisational confidence in underlying systems and processes.
