# Gamedays
***

We continuously conduct game days across our applications to simulate high levels of traffic and failure scenarios based
off of scenarios from our [runbooks](runbooks.md).

These will be conducted with the engineering and product team and sometimes with the wider business, to ensure production
readiness.

The aims of gamedays are as follows,

- To simulate production loads using [load tests](load-testing.md) to provide developer's with confidence around
production monitoring.
- To shed light on failure scenarios that we have not taken into account.
- To help the engineering team anticipate the stress of operating systems in a high traffic production environment.
- To gain organisational confidence in underlying systems and processes.
