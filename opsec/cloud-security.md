# Cloud Security

By adopting Serverless, we shift many of the traditional concerns towards our cloud provider (AWS). As the vast majority 
of our application & infrastructure are now Serverless. 

With No Infrastructure Based Protections, our Security is Reduced to Good Coding and Strict Configuration.

Our key security considerations can be found below.

- [Authentication of users](#authentication-of-users)
- [Authorization controls when accessing application and data](#authorization-controls)
- [Log and maintain audit trails of all access to application and data](#audit-trail)
- [Deploy an application layer firewall for event-data inspection](#application-layer-firewall)
- [Detect and fix vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies](#dependency-vulnerabilities)
- [Least-privileged roles and permissions](#least-privileged-access)
- [Enforce legitimate application behavior](#legitimate-application-behavior)
- [Data leak prevention](#data-leak-prevention)
- [Scan code and configurations statically during development](#static-analysis)
- [Removal of obsolete/unused cloud services and functions](#obsolete-application--service-removal)
- [End to end Observability](#end-to-end-observability)
- [Security incidents](#security-incidents)
