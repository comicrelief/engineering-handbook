# Production Requirements
***

Our production requirements outline the basic tooling set-up, creation of a build pipeline, and how we work our way all
the way up to production deployment and day to day operation.

Our aim is to continuously deliver all products and services that we are creating and maintaining. All services that we 
are creating and products that we are putting out, should contain or have undertaken the following steps. Everyone in 
the software development life cycle is responsible for the security & operation of our products and services.

## Architectural Review

When approaching a system that utilises cloud technologies that we do not currently have in our stack or is 
different to anything that we have in our stack. We should look to our cloud partners to provide architectural review at
both the scoping of the project and productionisation of a system. 

By engaging cloud partners at the start of a project,
we can ensure that our approach is sound and we are taking the best route to achieve what we want, our cloud partners
generally have a wide range of experience from different organisations and can be invaluable at this stage. 

By engaging cloud partners prior to taking a project into production, we can run through every section of the 
architecture and discuss assumptions. The review covers the following areas,

- Operational Excellence
- Security
- Reliability
- Performance Efficiency
- Cost Optimization

See the [third party validation](third-party-validation.md) documentation for more information on how we approach 
architectural review.
