# Third Party Validation

Both on a yearly basis and when provisioning new applications and services, we will engage security specialists and 
industry leaders to conduct testing against,

- Assets
- OSS software
- Cloud Infrastructure
- Products and operations
- Vendor products

These reviews can, but are not limited to the following testing,

- Conduct vulnerability research against all assets.
- Research FOSS tools that are integrated within Comic Relief applications.
- Conduct vulnerability research against SaaS apps and other products that are used by us.
- Automated scanning of architecture
- Network and user penetration

For systems built (or significantly modified) which contain customer and/or sensitive data, we should
undertake application security reviews with a third party specialist to ensure the system is hardened in case of
attack.

## Providers

### AWS
When provisioning a new service or application we will generally always engage an AWS solution architect to validate the
ideas being implemented within our systems and ensure that we are aligning ourselves with industry best practices.

When taking applications into production we will conduct a well architected review alongside AWS to ensure that we are
and have built the application inline with the best possible standards.

### NCC

NCC conduct yearly penetration testing on all of our core applications to ensure we are in line with current security
recommendations.

### RSM

RSM have conducted audits against application logic and bossiness worthiness of our internal systems and software 
development practices.

### Sage
