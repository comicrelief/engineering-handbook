## Staff Accounts
As a team we have the following requirements that reduce security risks, these should be implemented in addition to the 
Comic Relief IT policy.

### Use a password manager

Use a password manager to store your passwords. This way, you only need to memorize a few strong passwords: your master 
password for the password manager and your laptop password. Make sure that the password manager supports two factor 
authentication and that the password manager password is unique.

### Enable two factor authentication (if available)

Use 2 factor authentication whenever it is available. This should allow you to mitigate most risks from password 
compromise.

### Use your Comic Relief email account

Don't use your personal email account to register for services. Comic Relief provides spam and virus filtering which
will detect a wide range of vulnerabilities.

### No shared accounts

Unless there is no other option, then do not share your passwords or account with other members of staff.

### Use unique and strong passwords

Use your password manager to generate a random unique password with a minimum of 12 characters for each service you use
