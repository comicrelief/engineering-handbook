# OKRs
***

OKRs stands for *Objectives and Key Results*, and are our quarterly objectives.

They lay out our plan to execute our strategy, and help make sure our goals
(and how to achieve them) are clearly defined and aligned throughout our team.
*Objectives* help us understand what we're aiming to achieve, while the
*Key Results* help to paint a picture of how we'll measure the success of the
objectives.

OKRs will be conducted with your line manager.

We set new OKRs and review the past quarter's OKRs every quarter. Quarters are
defined as follows:

* **Q1** - January to March
* **Q2** - April to June
* **Q3** - July to September
* **Q4** - October to December

Note that we do not currently run OKRs in **Q1**, as this quarter is usually
taken up by campaign delivery and by nature already has well defined goals and
outcomes.

We utilise [Gtmhub](https://gtmhub.com/) to store and analyse OKRs. This can be
accessed using your Comic Relief SSO login (see below for the login link).
