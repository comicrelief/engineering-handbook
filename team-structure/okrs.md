# OKR's
***

OKRs stand for Objectives and Key Results and are our quarterly objectives.

They lay out our plan to execute our strategy and help make sure our goals and how to achieve that are clearly defined 
and aligned throughout our team. The Objectives help us understand what we're aiming to do, and the Key Results help 
paint the picture of how we'll measure success of the objective.

OKR's will be conducted with your line manager.

We set new OKR's and review past quarter OKR's every quarter, our quarters are defined as follows,

* **Q1** - January to March
* **Q2** - April to June
* **Q3** - July to September
* **Q4** - October to December

It is important to note that we do not currently run OKR's in **Q1**, this quarter is usually taken up by campaign 
delivery and by nature already has very defined goals and outcomes.

We utilise GTMHub to store and analyse OKR's, this can be accessed using your Comic Relief SSO login.
