# Coding Standards

Coding standards makes sure that all the developers working on the project are following certain specified guidelines. 
The code can be easily understood and a proper consistency is maintained across commits and projects.

Ensuring consistency has a positive impact on the quality of the project and one should ensure that it is maintained 
while coding. Also, it should be taken care that the guidelines are homogeneously followed across different levels of 
the system and they do not contradict each other. The finished program code should look like that it has been written by 
a single developer, in a single session.

We automate coding standards wherever possible, to ensure the least hassle for engineers. We implement coding standards
for the following reasons.

- Enhanced Efficiency
- Risk of project failure is reduced
- Minimise Complexity
- Easy to maintain
