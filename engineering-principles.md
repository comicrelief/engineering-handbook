# Engineering Principles

We like to apply the following engineering principles in the way we develop our services and digital products.

* Reusable services as engineering products
* API-first
* Cloud-native
* Real-time data and monitoring
* [Accessibility](frontend/accessibility.md) at the heart of everything
* Going beyond the screen

We approach those principles in the following manner:

* Development of services over maintaining infrastructure and manual scaling. Functions over microservices, microservices over monoliths, managed services over self-managed services. [12-factor apps](https://12factor.net/) where applicable
* Use of and contribute to open source software. [Coding in the open as our default setting](open-source.md).
* Continuous delivery backed up by automated testing. Deploy to production systems multiple times a day.
* Real-time monitoring of live products through dashboards (e.g. Grafana), logs (e.g. Loggly, CloudWatch) and alerts (e.g. Wormly, Slack)
* Everything in code and everything code reviewed. In-code and live documentation over wiki documentation.
